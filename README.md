# PrivateEthTransactionApp

This will be an experimental project to create an front-end only web application, preferable fully decentralised (IPFS, ENS, ...).

The front end will be made with react.js, the communication with the ethereum blockchain will be through the web3.js library.
All transactions will be made private by the Aztec protocol.
